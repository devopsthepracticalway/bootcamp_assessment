Name: Wilfred Oziegbe Oamen
-I believe I should be considered for this bootcamp because of my strong motivation to learn and my commitment to building a career in DevOps. I have taken steps to equip myself with relevant skills, e.g., Linux, Git and GitHub, etc., and I’m eager to expand my skill set in DevOps practices. I am a quick learner, highly adaptable, and enthusiastic about embracing new challenges, which will allow me to make the most of this bootcamp’s experience. 
- From this bootcamp, I expect to gain comprehensive hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies, such as automation, CI/CD pipelines, cloud technologies, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and monitoring. I also look forward to learning best practices for building scalable, efficient, and secure systems. Ultimately, I want to emerge from this bootcamp with the practical skills, confidence, and knowledge necessary to thrive in a DevOps role and contribute meaningfully to a team’s success
